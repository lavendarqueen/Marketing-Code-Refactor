# Marketing Code Refactor Repository

## Description

-This website is a refactoring of a Marketing firm that offers search engine optimization, online reputation management, social media marketing, as well as lead generation, brand awareness, and cost management. The refactoring included debugging of missing elements and adding aesthetic elements.

## Installation

-Debugged missing id on search optimization link to correct nonworking search optimization nav link.
-Added a narrow white border outlined in black to conform to user acceptance criteria.
-Moved nav links inside header to conform to user acceptance criteria.
-Added alt text to image tags in html file.
-Debugged background-size to make background-image responsive.

## Usage

-The refactoring of this website was intended to address aesthetics, acccessibility and debugging to meet user acceptance criteria.
